Make player specator at the next level !

This plugin allows to make a better spectator mode:			
			
- Private spectator chat
- TP compass (tp to players by using the compass)
- Back to lobby bed (back to the lobby using the bed)
- No block no-clip (not passing thought block in arenas)
- Spectator see other spectators
- View as mode (tap on an entity and view as you were it)
- Way more to add !
